h1. Difference from the Original SecureSocial

It supports Play 2.1 and Scala 2.10.

The UserService trait defines asynchronous APIs based on Scala's Future. If you access database asynchronously (e.g. using Play's asynchronous APIs), the modified API may be easier to work with.

h1. SecureSocial for Play 2 

SecureSocial allows you to add an authentication UI to your app that works with services based on OAuth1, OAuth2 and OpenID protocols.  SecureSocial provides Scala and Java APIs so you can integrate it using your preferred language.
